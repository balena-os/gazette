    - subject: Add support for byte arrrays
      hash: a19270c88aab38cc4876e34824afa8f49ed51f9d
      body: |
        A log entry containing a byte encoded message would cause jq to return
        an error `cannot add <string> to array`. This converts the message into
        a string before adding it to the log stream.

    - subject: Add log priority 'none' to disable service
      hash: a0f799b38651dbda8142d08981f4434fa3028d3a
      body: |
        This renames the configuration `JOURNAL_LOGLEVEL` to `JOURNAL_PRIORITY`
        (`JOURNAL_LOGLEVEL` is still available but deprecated). It also adds a
        new option for priority: `none`, indicating the service to ignore any
        log events of any type. If this option is given, the service will shut
        down to save resources.

        This creates the first version of the block with the minimal
        functionality for it to operate. The block by default listens for
        `openvpn` and `kernel` logs and collects any logs that have priority
        error or above.
