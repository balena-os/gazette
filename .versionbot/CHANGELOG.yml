    - subject: Add log priority 'none' to disable service
      hash: a0f799b38651dbda8142d08981f4434fa3028d3a
      body: |
        This renames the configuration `JOURNAL_LOGLEVEL` to `JOURNAL_PRIORITY`
        (`JOURNAL_LOGLEVEL` is still available but deprecated). It also adds a
        new option for priority: `none`, indicating the service to ignore any
        log events of any type. If this option is given, the service will shut
        down to save resources.

        This creates the first version of the block with the minimal
        functionality for it to operate. The block by default listens for
        `openvpn` and `kernel` logs and collects any logs that have priority
        error or above.
