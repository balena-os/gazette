description: >-
  A simple log collection agent that follows the logs for user defined services and agregates them 
  in a single stream. This allows the supervisor to collect and send the logs to the API and provides
  users and support agents with an extra source of data to diagnose potential device issues. By default only 
  log entries with priority error or higher are collected.
